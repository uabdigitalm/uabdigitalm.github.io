        Okay, so this is how the update function works in Phaser.
        
        "is intended to update positions, physics, scores, to manage user inputs, to invoke collision callbacks, to kill or revive objects, 
        and so on. It's the heart of your game really. Remember, unless drawing graphics by your own, you don't have to code object rendering, 
        Phaser does it for you on the object creation order basis."
        Source:
        https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/wiki/Phaser-General-Documentation-:-States
        
        The update function is where all the live updates would go once the main items have been created.  
        I'm using this to check if the student/player has completed the states and replacing the click images with red, non-clickable images.
        This is my first time using Phaser, so I'm actually not replacing the sprite using the statements I have created, but simply placing
        them on top of the other.  There is probably a better way to do this, but as of now, this is how I'm getting it to work.  It will
        really matter when asset management becomes a factor if the game gets larger.  
        In the same statements, I am ensuring that the images are not clickable via boolean var.
        
        You can do this with anything.  If you want the user to do something and provoke a function in the state, you want to put them in the update 
        function usually.
